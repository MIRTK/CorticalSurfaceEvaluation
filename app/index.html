        <h1>Cortical Surface Evaluation</h1>
        <p>
          App for manual evaluation of the automatically reconstructed cortical surfaces.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Thank you!</h4>
      <p>
        Thanks for volunteering to evaluate the reconstructed surfaces!
      </p>
      <p>
        Please use this application to record your assessment in the provided database file.
        This file usually has a <code>.db</code> file name extension, e.g.,
        <mark>recon-neonatal-cortex.db</mark>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This App supports two types of evaluation tasks: The assignment of quality scores given
        a screenshot taken from a render of a subregion of the MR brain volume overlaid with exactly
        one cortical surface contour, and the comparison of two cortical surface contours produced
        by different algorithms. The evaluation task assessing the quality of the individual
        surfaces should be performed before the comparison task(s). Screenshots discarded during
        the evaluation of the accuracy are also excluded from the comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that scores are recorded in the database as soon as a button is clicked or when the
        key on your keyboard corresponding to your rating is released again. You can take a break at
        any point, keep the application window in the background, or close it and open again later.
        Your progress is shown on the Tasks page after opening and logging into the database as well
        as the top right corner of each task interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have read the help below, switch to the
        <a href="#" onclick="showPage('open');"">Tasks</a> page to get started.

      <h4>Evaluation Task: Rate quality of individual contours</h4>
      <p>
        The goal of an evaluation task is to assess the quality of the results generated by a cortical
        surface reconstruction. Local surface contours that follow the true tissue boundary more
        accurately should be assigned higher scores than those with mistakes. For each brain scan,
        you are presented a number of screenshots, one at a time, taken from local regions of interest
        (ROIs) that have been pre-selected either based on quantitative criteria such as considerable
        disagreement between tissue segmentation and reconstructed surface or been chosen randomly.
        This preselectoin is done to reduce the number of contours that must be assessed manually.
        These 2D renders can be in any of the three orthogonal viewing directions of a given ROI.
        The evaluation interface is shown in Figure 1 below.
      </p>
      <figure class="center-text">
        <img src="evaluate-accuracy.png" alt="Example screenshot of an evaluation task" />
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example screenshot of the quality assessment interface.<br />
          Note that the scores and the respective colors of the buttons and keyboard<br />
          shortcuts may vary depending on the information stored in the database file.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Note that the surface contours may correspond to either one of the cortical surfaces reconstructed
        by each of the algorithms that are being compared against each other in this evaluation study.
        Therefore you will notice that the same images are shown multiple times, but with different
        surface contours. When the surfaces are very similar, this may seem as if the same image is
        shown twice, whereby in fact you are rating two different surface contours.
        Which screenshot is shown next is chosen randomly from all screenshots taken from any of the
        brain scans included in the study with any of the surface contours overlaid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your task is to assign one of the scores listed below by clicking the corresponding button,
        or by pressing the respective key on your keyboard. A brief description of the meaning of
        each score and when to assign it is given below. Note that the scores to be assigned are
        read from the database file. The following list will be show the actual scores and 
        their meaning only after you opened the database file.
        <table id="help-scores" class="table borderless">

              <td>Contour substantially deviates from tissue boundary.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><button class="btn btn-score btn-info">2-<strong>F</strong>air [left]</button></td>
              <td>Contour close, but with some more obvious mistakes.</td>
            </tr>

              <td><button class="btn btn-score btn-primary">3-<strong>G</strong>ood [up]</button></td>
              <td>Contour mainly correct, with minor mistakes.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><button class="btn btn-score btn-success">4-<strong>E</strong>xcellent [right]</button></td>
              <td>Contour follows the tissue boundary.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        You can enter the scores by either clicking the respective button, or pressing the key on your keyboard
        corresponding to the numeric score value, e.g., "2" for "Fair", or by pressing the key corresponding to
        the first bold highlighted letter of the corresponding verbal score, i.e., "f" for "Fair" and "g" for "Good".
        Alternatively, use the arrow keys indicated in square brackets, i.e., press the right arrow key to
        assign the score "Good".

        <div class="card-block">
          When you discard a screenshot as not being suitable to assess the quality of the
          surface contours, all screenshots with the same field of view from this zoomed in
          region of interest that were not rated yet are discarded as well. Morover,
          screenshots for the comparison of two surface contours in the other tasks 
          taken from the same ROI are then also excluded from these tasks.

        <div class="card-block">
          Contours of a surface intersected by an image slice may appear to not be close to the
          tissue boundary in one view, but would appear more accurate in a slice slightly above or below
          the one shown. This is mainly the case where the direction of the gyrus goes out of plane
          which sometimes can be seen from the intensity images. Where there is a clear tissue boundary
          between white matter and cortical grey matter and the cortex has locally near constant
          thickness, this is unlikely the case and the contour should be close to the tissue boundary.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>Comparison Task: Which one is better?</h4>
      <p>
        In these tasks, you are shown volume slice renders with two different cortical surfaces
        obtained using two different methods for cortical surface reconstruction. The two contours
        of the surfaces intersected with the respective image plane are displayed in different colors.
        For each ROI view you are shown three renders: a comparison view with both contours overlaid
        and two separate renders with only one of the two contours shown in each.
        This comparison interface is shown in Figure 2.

      </figure>
      <p>
        Your task is to choose which of the two differently colored contours depicts the true tissue
        boundary seen in the MR image more accurately by pressing either the button labeled "A" or
        the button labeled "B", depending on which button has the color of your chosen contour.
        When both contours delineate the boundary either perfectly well or contain comparable
        errors, please choose the option "Neither".
      </p>
      <p>
        You can enter your choice either by clicking the respective button or by pressing the key
        on your keyboard corresponding to your choice, i.e., "a" for choice A, "b" for choice B,
        and "n" for neither choice. Alternativley, use the left arrow for choice A, the right
        arrow for choice B, and the down or up arrows for neither choice.

        <div class="card-block">
          The color of each contour and the assignment of a surface to choice "A" or "B",
          respectively, is picked randomly each time. This is to avoid bias in your choice.
          Please inspect the images carefully before choosing "A", "B", or "Neither".
